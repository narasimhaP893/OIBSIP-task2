            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>For India he is the father of the Nation just as George Washington is the father of America. 
				As a mark of respect for him, we call him Gandhiji. His father’s name was Karamchand Gandhi and 
				mother’s name was Putlibai. He was born in Porbandar, in the state of Gujarat.

                His mother was very religious. Gandhiji too was very religious. It once so happened that a group of 
				people came to perform a drama in Porbandar. It was about the ancient King Harishchandra who was very truthful. 
				Gandhiji saw how much Harishchandra had to suffer to be truthful. This had a lasting effect on Gandhiji.
				 He decided that he would also always tell the truth.
                 Soon truth became his way of life. He made up his mind that even if the truth led him to trouble, he would never give it up.
                
                One day, his father gave him a book about Shravan who was extremely devoted to his parents. Gandhiji quickly finished the book.
				 He saw a picture in which Shravan was carrying his parents on his shoulders, since both of them were blind, and wanted 
				 to go to all the holy places. Gandhiji decided that he would also take care of his parents.
                
                When his father went to the temple, he took Gandhiji with him. When Jain monks visited their house, they discussed 
				religious matter and Gandhiji attentively listened. Leaders of other religions also visited them and they discussed their religions. 
				Gandhiji was influenced by different religions in his life.
                
                Gandhiji was also vegetarian. When he decided to go to Europe to study law, his mother told him, “My son, since you are going abroad, 
				make sure that you never drink alcohol, eat meat, or indulge in gambling.” Gandhiji gave his promise to his mother to abide by her wish
				 and took a vow in the presence of a monk that he would never drink alcohol, eat meat, or resort to gambling.
                
                Gandhiji used to say, “If someone is kind and generous to us, we should return that favor; but we should be kind and generous even to 
				those who do not possess those qualities.” Mahatma Gandhi was virtuous and will always be remembered for that.</p>
            <h2>Achievements</h2>
            <p>Mahatma Gandhi was one of the greatest national and civil rights leaders of the 20th century. He served as a lawyer, politician, 
				and activist in the struggle for social justice and for India’s independence from British rule. Gandhi is internationally esteemed 
				for his doctrine of nonviolent protest (satyagraha) to achieve political and social progress.</p>
            <h3>The Development Of satyagraha</h3>
            <p>When he moved to South Africa in 1893, Gandhi quickly encountered racial discrimination. In a Durban court he was asked by the 
				European magistrate to take off his turban; he refused and left the courtroom. A few days later, while traveling to Pretoria,
				 he was thrown out of a first-class railway compartment and was later beaten up by the white driver of a stagecoach
                 because he would not travel on the footboard to make room for a European passenger.He was also barred from hotels reserved 
				 “for Europeans only.” But something happened to Gandhi as he smarted under the insults heaped upon him. That journey from
				  Durban to Pretoria was his moment of truth. Henceforth he would not accept injustice. He would defend his dignity as an 
                 Indian and as a man. Gandhi fought with mixed success against South Africa’s system of discrimination. He founded the Natal 
				 Indian Congress, and his writings exposed to the world the injustices suffered by Indians and others. In 1906 satyagraha 
				 (“devotion to truth”) was born as a technique of nonviolent resistance. By the time Gandhi returned to India in 1915, he had 
                 developed satyagraha into an effective tool in the fight for social justice.</p>
            <h3>Achieving India independence</h3>
            <p>By 1920 Gandhi was India’s dominant political figure, exerting a broad influence over the Indian population. 
				The Indian National Congress (Congress Party) became a mass organization that Gandhi led in nonviolent actions. 
				These included boycotts of British goods as well as British legislatures, courts, offices, and schools. In 1930 Gandhi 
				launched the Salt March as a protest against a British tax on salt. The march was one of the most successful of Gandhi’s campaigns. 
				Yet by 1934 he had become disillusioned with the infighting among Congress Party members. He turned to building the nation 
				“from the bottom up.” By emphasizing rural education, social equality, and cottage industries, Gandhi believed India could 
				become peaceful and self-sufficient. The final struggle for Indian independence began in 1942. Gandhi demanded an immediate 
				British withdrawal from India, known as the Quit India Movement. Over the next five years Gandhi struggled to help Muslim, Hindu, 
				
				and British leaders negotiate Indian independence. He was unable to block the Mountbatten Plan, which divided the subcontinent into a 
				Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority East and West Pakistan. On August 15, 1947, India achieved its independence. 
				Gandhi worked to stop the Muslim-Hindu riots that followed. On January 30, 1948, he was assassinated by a Hindu radical
				 who was upset by Gandhi’s efforts to reconcile Hindus and Muslims.</p>
